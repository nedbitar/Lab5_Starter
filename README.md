1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

I would use unit tests to make sure that the messages sent are being exactly the same as the messages recieved. You can also write tests to see how the program will react with special characters and no text.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

I would use unit tests to make sure the user cannot exceed the specified limit. I would test it in several languages to see how my code would function in those various languages.
